            <h2 class="major"><a href="/">LuxembourgJS</a> - Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the
                following
                code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from
                all
                participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

            <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
            <p>Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
                gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race,
                ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
                meetup
                participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue,
                including
                talks, networking, social events, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating
                these
                rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the meetup organisers.</p>

            <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>

            <p>A primary goal of LuxembourgJS is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the
                most
                varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
                welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
                socioeconomic
                status, and religion (or lack thereof).
                This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as
                well as
                the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We will also apply those rules for the selection of
                speakers,
                sponsors, and venues.
                We invite all those who participate in LuxembourgJS to help us create a safe and positive experience
                for
                everyone.</p>

                    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack

            <h4>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
            <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making
                authority, will not be tolerated.
                Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
                If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem
                appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without
                warning.</p>

            <h4>Reporting an incident</h4>
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
                please

            <p>We expect all participants (attendees; sponsors; speakers; hosts; and other guests) to abide by this
